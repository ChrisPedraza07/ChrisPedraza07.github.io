                            <p>An action/mystery game set in a vibrant, sugary-treat–themed world that’s slowly slipping into chaos. 
                                You play as Officer Pinkglaze, a seasoned donut cop who thought he’d seen it all… until now.

                            <h4>Battle Arena</h4>
                            <p>Battle Arena is my first 3D game and as well as my first local co-op game.
                                Two players on opposing sides of the arena battle to reach the other player's base to
                                score points.
                                Each player has Defending bots that will attack the other player as they try to reach
                                the base.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I made the player and bot models in Blender and added simple animations to them.
                                I created the arena in Unity and used C# to program the game mechanics. this project was
                                a good introduction to 3D game development, Unity's new input sytem
                                and the workflow between creating models in Blender and importing them into Unity.

                            <h4>Killer Candy</h4>
                            <p>
                                I wanted to make a 3rd person mob shooter somewhat inspired by autoshooters like Vampire Survivors; I love that style of gameplay but wanted to make something that requires a little more player involvment. My idea was  to add 3rd person shooting into the mix as well as the addition of player triggered powerups along with autoshooting powerups and passive powerups. 
                                I really have no story for the candy theme, I just liked the idea of zombie candy, Adventure time / Wreck it Ralph inspired. 
                                Assets were created in blender and game engine is Unity.

                            <p>
                        A mobile game where the player uses their thumbs to control each shoe in order to juggle the hacky sack and performs tricks. 
                        This is a prototype that currently has working gameplay, score counter, and some tricks. 
                        I'm not sure if I will complete this game, but I thought it was a fun idea for a mobile game so I went ahead and made this prototype.

                                I also learned how to use C# to program the game mechanics.

                                This was my first group project, my responsibilites were
                                character creation/animation and I did some of the movement scripting. </p>
                            <p>I learned a lot about how to effectively work in a group and that communication is key to
                                success.I also learned
                                how AR can be implemented in different ways.
